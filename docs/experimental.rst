Experimental functionality
==========================

**Functionality is not guaranteed**

All classes and functions which are found in `fastf1.experimental` are still under development.
They may not work as expected or may have undocumented bugs. Documentation in general may still be lacking or may
not be present at all yet. (If you consider the non-experimental documentation bad already, well, sorry I guess.)
