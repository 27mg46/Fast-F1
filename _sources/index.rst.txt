.. F1 Telemetry documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.


.. note:: **Update required**

    An update to the latest version of FastF1 (v2.1.10) is **required** to
    adapt to changes in an external API.
    Without this update you will only be able to load previously cached data!
    If you use FastF1 version 2.1.9 or older you need to update to the latest
    version.

    Use ``pip install --upgrade fastf1`` to update to the latest version.

Introduction
============

FastF1 gives you access to F1 lap timing, car telemetry and position,
tyre data, weather data and weekend information among others.
No formula1 account is needed.

The module is designed around Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. This makes it easy
to use while offering lots of possibilities for data analysis and
visualization.

FastF1 handles big chunks of data (~50-100mb per session) so most of the
information is stored locally as cached requests (be aware).

All data is downloaded from two sources:

    - The official f1 data stream ->
      `f1-live <https://www.formula1.com/en/f1-live.html>`_
    - Ergast web api -> `ergast.com <http://ergast.com/mrd/>`_

Have fun!
