Fast F1 documentation
=====================

For the passionate F1 nerds.

Introduction
============

FastF1 gives you access to F1 lap timing, car telemetry and position,
tyre data, weather data and weekend information among others.
No formula1 account is needed.

The module is designed around Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. This makes it easy
to use while offering lots of possibilities for data analysis and
visualization.

FastF1 handles big chunks of data (~50-100mb per session) so most of the
information is stored locally as cached requests (be aware).

All data is downloaded from two sources:

    - The official f1 data stream ->
      `f1-live <https://www.formula1.com/en/f1-live.html>`_
    - Ergast web api -> `ergast.com <http://ergast.com/mrd/>`_

Have fun!
